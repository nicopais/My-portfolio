                <h1> Self intro</h1>
                <p>Greetings! My name is Nicole Cabrera, I am 19 years old and when I first came to the U.S. I dreamed of pursuing a career in the medical field and becoming a Pediatrician. However, after experiencing many life changing events, covid being the most significant, I began to reevaluate my career path and slowly realized that I needed a career that quenched my thirst for knowledge and innovation with very small time needed to earn a certificate. And even though I don't have a history to show my passion for web designing I am still motivated to learn everything I can to become the best software engineer I can possibly be. I see software as a language that I am determined to learn even if I struggle to comprehend at first. Learning software engineering is important to me because it is the key to my future success. I see that the job market for software developing is always expanding and people are always coming up with new AI software and I would like to understand what has to be done behind the scenes for the technology to advance.

                <p>While I don't have a set schedule, there are a few things I enjoy doing regularly which I consider as hobbies. One of those things is reading manga. Some of my favorite genre to read together are phsycological thriller and boyslove. 
                My other hobby which I don't do as often but enjoy none the less are listening to stories about mythical creatures and watching movie theory videos. And when I say "movie theory" videos I am not talking about that YouTube channel specifically, I am talking about in general.
                One of my favorite and most recently heard of, myths is that the there was once a handsome young indiginous warrior that infuriated the god of the river and was transformed into a pink dolfin. There are many stories told of how he supposedly infuriated the god of the river, but they all agree with one thing. 
                That when he turns into his human form, he seduces beautiful young women and allures them into the water spending the night with them, and when the night is over, the women can't remember what happened and nine months later, an infant is born. 
                This myth is mostly found on a few parts of South America, such as Brazil and Peru. </p>
